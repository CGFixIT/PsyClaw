# Session Wrap-Up

Run four phases in order. Each phase is conversational and inline — no
separate documents. All phases auto-apply without asking; present a
consolidated report at the end.

## Phase 1: Ship It

**Commit:**
1. Run `git status` in each repo directory that was touched during the session.
2. If uncommitted changes exist, commit them to a `claude/wrap-up-<slug>` branch and open a draft PR. Never commit directly to `main`.
3. Push to remote (if needed).

**Task cleanup:**
1. Check the task list for in-progress or stale items.
2. Mark completed tasks as done, flag orphaned ones.

## Phase 2: Remember It

Review what was learned during the session. Decide where each piece of
knowledge belongs in the memory hierarchy:

**Memory placement guide:**
- **Auto memory** (Claude writes for itself) — Debugging insights, patterns
  discovered during the session, project quirks. Tell Claude to save these:
  "remember that..." or "save to memory that..."
- **CLAUDE.md** (instructions for Claude) — Permanent project rules,
  conventions, commands, architecture decisions that should guide all future
  sessions
- **`.claude/rules/`** (modular project rules) — Topic-specific instructions
  that apply to certain file types or areas. Use `paths:` frontmatter to scope
  rules to relevant files (e.g., testing rules scoped to `tests/**`)
- **`CLAUDE.local.md`** (private per-project notes) — Personal WIP context,
  local URLs, sandbox credentials, current focus areas that shouldn't be
  committed
- **`@import` references** — When a CLAUDE.md would benefit from referencing
  another file rather than duplicating its content

**Decision framework:**
- Is it a permanent project convention? → CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/`
- Is it scoped to specific file types? → `.claude/rules/` with `paths:`
  frontmatter
- Is it a pattern or insight Claude discovered? → Auto memory
- Is it personal/ephemeral context? → `CLAUDE.local.md`
- Is it duplicating content from another file? → Use `@import` instead

Note anything important in the appropriate location.

## Phase 3: Review & Apply

Analyze the conversation for self-improvement findings. If the session was
short or routine with nothing notable, say "Nothing to improve" and proceed
to Phase 4.

**Auto-apply all actionable findings immediately** — do not ask for approval
on each one. Apply the changes, commit them, then present a summary of what
was done.

**Finding categories:**
- **Skill gap** — Things Claude struggled with, got wrong, or needed multiple
  attempts
- **Friction** — Repeated manual steps, things user had to ask for explicitly
  that should have been automatic
- **Knowledge** — Facts about projects, preferences, or setup that Claude
  didn't know but should have
- **Automation** — Repetitive patterns that could become skills, hooks, or
  scripts

**Action types:**
- **CLAUDE.md** — Edit the relevant project or global CLAUDE.md
- **Rules** — Create or update a `.claude/rules/` file
- **Auto memory** — Save an insight for future sessions
- **Skill / Hook** — Document a new skill or hook spec for implementation
- **CLAUDE.local.md** — Create or update per-project local memory

Present a summary after applying, in two sections — applied items first,
then no-action items:

Findings (applied):

1. ✅ Skill gap: Cost estimates were wrong multiple times
   → [CLAUDE.md] Added token counting reference table

2. ✅ Knowledge: Worker crashes on 429/400 instead of retrying
   → [Rules] Added error-handling rules for worker

3. ✅ Automation: Checking service health after deploy is manual
   → [Skill] Created post-deploy health check skill spec

---
No action needed:

4. Knowledge: Discovered X works this way
   Already documented in CLAUDE.md

## Phase 4: Publish It

After all other phases are complete, review the full conversation for material
that could be published. Look for:

- Interesting technical solutions or debugging stories
- Community-relevant announcements or updates
- Educational content (how-tos, tips, lessons learned)
- Project milestones or feature launches

**If publishable material exists:**

Draft the article(s) for the appropriate platform and save to a drafts folder.
Present suggestions with the draft:

All wrap-up steps complete. I also found potential content to publish:

1. "Title of Post" — 1-2 sentence description of the content angle.
   Platform: Reddit
   Draft saved to: Drafts/Title-Of-Post/Reddit.md

Wait for the user to respond. If they approve, post or prepare per platform.
If they decline, the drafts remain for later.

**If no publishable material exists:**

Say "Nothing worth publishing from this session" and you're done.

**Scheduling considerations:**
- If the session produced multiple publishable items, do not post them all
  at once
- Space posts at least a few hours apart per platform
- If multiple posts are needed, post the most time-sensitive one now and
  present a schedule for the rest

## Notes

Do not skip phases. Present a consolidated report at the end. Phase 1's
branch/draft-PR rule is a hard rule (`CLAUDE.md` §7, §10): never commit
directly to `main`, even at session end, even with the session's own prior
approvals — a fresh PR still gets human review.
